# Rahul_100

This notebook is for the bonus assignment. 

This notebook contains the code for:

a. Training the decision tree and the extra tree
b. Performing visualizations of the data using python

## Description

This notebook buiilds on the models trained on the 100 genes data set and then peform visualizations of the results.
I initially wanted to focus on the 1000 genes data set or even the 5000 genes data set, however what was happening was the
visualizations were pretty expensive to compute and pretty messy. Therefore, I simply focused on the 100 gene data set.


## PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES

The following packages are required to run this notebook to view the visualizations:

a. seaborn (for the heatmap)
b. pydotplus
c. matplotlib
d. pandas
e. numpy

## SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES:

You need to have Graphviz installed. This is required by Python to build the visualization of the tree model.
To set up your machine for this:

a. Download Graphviz  from here: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/
b. Add a path to the installed location to the PATH environment variable.


## RUNNING THE notebook

Open the notebook using jupyter notebooks.
Run All the cells. This will train the models and then create the plots for you.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
